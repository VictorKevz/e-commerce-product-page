## Overview

In this challenge, I built out a fully functional e-commerce product page that closely follows the provided design specifications. The solution includes a lightbox gallery, cart functionality, responsive layouts, and interactive elements with hover states.

## Features

### Challenge Features
- **Lightbox Gallery**: Users can open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image.
- **Thumbnail Image Switch**: Users can switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images.
- **Cart Functionality**: Users can add items to the cart, view the cart, and remove items from it.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adjusts optimally depending on the device's screen size.
- **Hover States**: Interactive elements display hover states.

### Additional Features
- **Scale Transformation on Hover**: Interactive elements scale up slightly on hover for a better user experience.
- **Animations on Entry**: Used Framer Motion to add smooth animations to elements when they appear on the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For development tooling and building the project.
- **Framer Motion**: For adding animations.
